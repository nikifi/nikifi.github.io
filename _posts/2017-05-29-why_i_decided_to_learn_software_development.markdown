My decision to learn Software Development happened over time. When I was an undergraduate student I started out majoring in Computer Science. I had no idea why I chose that major. I was lost and didnt really know what I would enjoy doing. I think I understimated the field and was unhappy at all the long hours I had to spend de-bugging and fixing errors. Eventually I changed my major to Electrical Engineering.

In my last semester I got fascinated with website applications - that is dynamic websites that did really cool stuff. I started dabbling with HTML and JavaScript in my free time and became hooked. I then realized that Computer Science would have been a good major to become a professional web developer. However, as I was almost ready to graduate switching back to that major was no longer an option.

Years passed and I continued to dabble. I took many courses at online colleges that gave me a good foundation on topics like PHP, HTML, JavaScript and MySQL. However many of those courses are geared to beginner developers so while I understoof the concepts I didnt exactly feel like I was ready to be a professional developer. 

I have a type A personality and I am not satisfied until perfection is achieved. I continue to pursue learning opportunities that will transform me into a rock star web developer. Ironically the things I previously hated about Computer Science is what I love about it now. There is little that is more rewarding than resolving bugs.
